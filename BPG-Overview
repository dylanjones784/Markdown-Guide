# Introduction
This is a best practice guide that is foundationally rooted in addressing the most common security concerns identified with Web APIs by OWASP, and layered with other standards that are from the likes of Microsoft, Google, IBM and more.

I believe that a collaborative, community-driven document is needed by the industry so that we are the driving force behind the common practices and standards. 

Following the following sections can, and will, help ensure that client experience is solid, by being:

- Seamless and Simple
- Efficient
- Consistent patterns across the API; Error Messages, Status 
is as seamless and simple as possible:




Simple, Consistent, Easy To Use, Adaptable , Efficient, Effective, Self-explanatory. This isn’t a do or don’t, this is amalgamation of standards that as a developer, you should follow, to promote those keywords.


We will be using keywords that should be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC2119, RFC8174. These are "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL”.
