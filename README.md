# Best Practice Guidelines for REST APIs

The BEST Practice Guideline for REST APIs was created for my dissertation project at Manchester Metropolitan University. The objective of this guide was to bring together the various industry standards and practices employed to make a “golden” ruleset for creating REST APIs, the most popular form of Web API technology to date.


The themes that are covered within this guide were identified came from a host of research, primarily from the likes of Google, Microsoft & IBM, as well as other sources that may not be as popular but still provided great insight. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project was used as basis for this guide, providing the skeletal foundation and ensuring that security is at the forefront of this guide. 



My guideline differs from other best practice guides, primarily from the fact that:

- In contract to other guidelines that often focus on specific technologies from their parent company, such Google Clouds REST APIs or Microsoft’s proprietary technologies, this guide advocates for a broader, technology and language-agnostic approach. The proposed set of standards encompass identified common issues, risks and standards that follow the lifecycle of REST APIs.


- I used Thematic Analysis on a host of research, gathering best practices and standards and identifying the common themes within them to ensure that my chosen topics were relevant and common enough that most viewers on this guide would appear reasonable.


- Establishing these standards required a Thematic Analysis to be done on the range of research material gathered from my Literature Review. The topics covered in this guide stemmed from the distilled best practices and standards by identifying the recurring themes from all my research.



- It is important to note that expecting developers to strictly adhere to every practice and standard is not practice nor feasible. Therefore, the aim of this guide is to provide a foundational framework for the common issues and challenges faced when creating REST and, by extension, all Web APIs.
