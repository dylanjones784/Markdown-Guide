What type of files do  i need ? 
Need to look at emperical standards 



THE FORMAT NEEDS LOOKING AT SO BAD
FORMAT OF PARAGRAPHS. Sentence Structure.


Ill want to link my C# .NET API that follows this API too. Showing off how i designed my resources etc.

Some sort of readme that contains an overview.


How do i show my examples?
How am i going to group up the files? 

How do i link to other sections? Are other sections going to be individual markdown templates?


Folder Resources -> Content?


Going to need to learn how to put images. Hyperlinks. Bulletpoints.
Tables.

Code snippets (that are copiable) for my JSON and C#.

Need my examples actually setup. So ill need my scenario fully set, with resource designs 
following my designs.



Any extension taht I can look at?
