What type of files do  i need ? 
Need to look at emperical standards 

Some sort of readme that contains an overview.


How do i show my examples?
How am i going to group up the files? 

How do i link to other sections? Are other sections going to be individual markdown templates?


Folder Resources -> Content?


Going to need to learn how to put images. Hyperlinks. Sublists.
Tables.

Code snippets (that are copiable)

Need my examples actually setup. So ill need my scenario fully set, with resource designs 
following my designs.



Any extension taht I can look at?
